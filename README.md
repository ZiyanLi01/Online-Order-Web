# Welcome to Yumi Food!
Yumi Food is my first full-stack project, passionately developed from the ground up. This project simulates a simple DoorDash-like service as a practice exercise, focusing on food ordering and delivery.

## Introduction
Yumi Food is a comprehensive project that brings together three core components: the backend, frontend, and database. This document outlines the structure and functionality of each component, explaining how they work together to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Backend Design
The backend is built using Spring MVC and Hibernate, enabling robust and scalable operations. Key features include:
RESTful APIs: Implemented for various operations such as user registration, menu searching, ordering, and checkout.
Data Access: Utilized Hibernate to interact with the database, managing data related to menus, restaurants, and more.
Security: Integrated Spring Security to provide both authentication and authorization, safeguarding the application from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
Modular Design: Leveraged Spring framework's core technologies to loosely decouple all components, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
The backend code is located in the "OnlineOrder" folder.


## Frontend Design
The frontend, crafted with React and Ant Design, offers a responsive and interactive user experience, enhancing engagement. 
The frontend code is available in the "oneline-order-front-end" folder.

## Database and Storage
MySQL manages user data and booking histories, ensuring secure and reliable storage.

## Reference
This project was initially inspired by the laioffer bootcamp. I've tailored it to align with my personal interests, adding unique features and customizations.
